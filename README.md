This is a repo of a list of CSS hacks that I am currently working on for the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) note taking app. Click on the title to look at the code 

# [Flush Inline Embeds](https://github.com/1stprinciples/Obsidian-hacks/blob/main/Block_reference_embed.css) 
I have tried my hand at improving the appearance of the inline embeds using CSS :)

Note: This impacts all types of embeds (link, header or block reference embed)

## Description
- I have removed the padding and the lines from the top and the bottom to make it look like inline text. 
- I have changed the colour of the link icon to make it more prominent. 
- The idea is that I would like the embed to be indistinguishable from an inline text except for the embed link pointing towards the source. 

## Future improvement
- When a indented item is referenced, it appears indented in the block reference embed. This impacts the aesthetic and has to be changed.
